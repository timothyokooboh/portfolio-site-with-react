                The major challenge I faced was trying to ensure that the chat component was robust as possible with 
                features similar to what is available in Whatsapp and Telegram. I had to enure that the chat component 
                grouped messages according to the dates the messages were posted. Also, it was a bit challenging displaying the number 
                of unread messages to the users.

                One of the challenges I faced was how to store and persist sensitive user's data without utilizing web storage e.g local storage.
                For example, I wanted to store data regarding whether a user has made payment or not. I knew that if I saved that information in web storage,
                the data could be manipulated by users. To solve that challenge, I leveraged the "nuxtServerInit" action 
                provided by Nuxt.js. So just before the client side is rendered to authenticated users, I retrieve the
                user's unique ID (provided by mongoDB) from cookies. Then I call a function that fetches the user's information from the server and 
                use the returned data to initialize Vuex store.
                That way, I only needed to store the user's ID in cookies and be rest assured that on page refresh, I will always retrieve
                the user's data from the server via server side rendering.
